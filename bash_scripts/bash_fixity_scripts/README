These scripts are used to facilitate the creation of md5 checksum file manifests for the purpose of ensuring file fixity 
during transfer and movement. They are adapted from scripts created and developed IFIscripts. https://github.com/Irish-Film-Institute/IFIscripts

###Points to note
1. For use with MacOS only. They are not suitable for Windows or Linux operating systems.
2. For use with a shell command prompt. To execute, open the Terminal command prompt on your Mac computer.
3. Logs and Manifests for each script executed are stored in Desktop in a folder called "ucclib_logs" and "ucclib_manifests" with the name of the log file indicating the script executed along with a timestamp of execution and name of the manifest file indicating the folder the script worked on.


###Installation:
Download bash_fixity_scripts folder to your desktop.
Open the Terminal command prompt on your Mac computer. 
Change the directory (cd) of the of the Terminal command from the home directory to the newly dowbloaded directory where your scripts are stored using the "cd" command

Example-
```bash
cd "/home/user/desktop/cash_fixity_scripts_ucc"
```

###Scripts

## A) manifest_creator.sh
### Summary: 
The purpose of this bash script is to generate the md5 checksum manifest file for each and every file for a given directory and store all the checksum results in a single file. 
An optional parameter "sidecar" could be passed while calling the script of execution with which the log file and manifest file is stored right beside the directory on which 
the script will work on. If sidecar isn't passed the logs and checksum file are stored in "ucclib_logs" and "ucclib_manifests" folders respectively.

### Arguments accespeted by this script:
1. -s : sidecar argument to store logs and checksum beside the directory the script operates on. (Optional)

### Usage:
Commands to execute this script in Terminal command prompt:
```bash
bash manifest_creator.sh "/home/user/directory1"
bash manifest_creator.sh "/home/user/directory1" -s
```

### Output:
"_manifest.md5" file
located in the 'ucclib_manifests' folder and (optional) as a sidecar to the input directory.

## B) copyfixity.sh
### Summary: 

The purpose of this script is to copy files from a source directory to a destination while ensuring data integrity through checksum validation. It calculates fixity checksums for each file in both the source and destination directories, compares them, and logs any discrepancies. If a mismatch is detected, it reports the failed files and advises re-copying them. The script generates detailed logs and checksum manifests for future reference, ensuring that all files are copied correctly and remain intact during the transfer.

        
### Usage:
Commands to execute the script in the command window :    
```bash    
bash copyfixity.sh "/home/user/<source-directory>" "/home/user/<destination-directory>"
```

### Output:
Folder completely copied to destination with fixity manifest file which has checksum details of all the files copied to destination.
